Microsoft Copilot Assistance Summary
Throughout the development of the EventEase App, Microsoft Copilot played a crucial role in accelerating the coding process, debugging issues, and optimizing performance. Here's how Copilot assisted at each stage:

ðŸŸ¢ Activity 1: Building the Foundational Components
Generated the Event Card Component

Suggested two-way data binding syntax for event name, date, and location fields.
Automatically structured the EventCard.razor component, reducing manual work.
Implemented Routing

Recommended the correct route definitions for event list and event details pages.
Ensured that navigation links followed best practices.
Created a Mock Data Model

Provided sample JSON-based event data to populate the event list dynamically.
ðŸŸ¢ Activity 2: Debugging and Optimization
Debugged Data Binding Issues

Identified missing validation for empty or invalid inputs.
Suggested using <EditForm> and <DataAnnotationsValidator> for validation.
Fixed Routing Errors

Ensured navigation handled non-existent pages gracefully using NotFound fallback.
Optimized Performance for Large Datasets

Suggested pagination and lazy loading for improved performance in the event list.
Provided an efficient way to fetch data asynchronously.
ðŸŸ¢ Activity 3: Implementing Advanced Features
Added a Registration Form with Validation

Assisted in implementing form validation using DataAnnotations.
Suggested best practices for handling user input.
Implemented State Management Using Local Storage

Recommended Blazored.LocalStorage as an alternative to ProtectedSessionStorage.
Assisted in storing user session data persistently.
Built an Attendance Tracker

Generated real-time list updates using Blazor event handling.
Suggested dynamic UI updates without page refresh.
Final Optimization for Deployment

Removed unused dependencies and redundant code.
Verified that the app followed Blazor performance best practices.
ðŸŽ¯ Final Impact of Copilot
âœ… Saved Development Time â†’ Autogenerated code templates for components and validation.
âœ… Reduced Debugging Effort â†’ Identified routing and input validation errors.
âœ… Improved Performance â†’ Suggested data fetching optimizations for large datasets.
âœ… Enhanced Code Readability â†’ Ensured cleaner and structured Blazor components.
